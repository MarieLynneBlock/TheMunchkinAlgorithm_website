# The Munchkin Algorithm

> **By day, I optimise algorithms for efficiency. By night, I build them to make you *feel* something.**

Welcome to my digital **.world**.

This repo isn't just a portfolio website; it's a **scrolling experience** disguised as a professional resume.

🌐 **Live Experience:** [themunchkinalgorithm.world](https://themunchkinalgorithm.world)

## 🚀 The Journey (Scroll to Experience)

The entire background is powered by **p5.js**. It doesn't play a video; it *renders* the universe in real-time based on your scroll behaviour.
Can you make the rocket fly? 🚀
Or make a wish on a falling star! 💫 
Or do you reach the jellyfish? 🪼

## 🎨 The "No Static Images" Manifesto

I have a strict rule for this `.world`:
**Every pixel must be separately programmed.**

* ❌ **No JPEGs.**
* ❌ **No PNGs.**
* ❌ **No GIFs.**
* ✅ **100% Code.**

*(Legal Disclaimer: The favicon is a static image because browser security rules are boring and won't let me render a canvas there yet. sadface.jpg 🤪.)*

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

This site is built on the intersection of **Logic** and **Creative Chaos**.

* **Engine:** [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (v1.7.0)
* **Style:** CSS3 with Glassmorphism (because we live in the future).
* **Fonts:** `Orbitron` (for the headers), `Rajdhani` (for the data), and `Montserrat` (for the humans).
* **Performance:**
    * Scroll events are **throttled** (16ms) so your laptop doesn't take off like the rocket in Zone 1.
    * Elements in "inactive zones" stop rendering to save your GPU.

## 💻 Run it Locally (If you dare)

Want to poke around the code or add your own sea monsters?

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MarieLynneBlock/TheMunchkinAlgorithm_website.git](https://github.com/MarieLynneBlock/TheMunchkinAlgorithm_website.git)
    ```

2.  **Run a local server:**
    *Note: Because of CORS policies, p5.js (and the browser) will yell at you if you just open `index.html` directly.*

    ```bash
    # If you have Python (you probably do):
    python -m http.server 8000

    # Or with Node.js:
    npx http-server
    ```

3.  **Visit:** `http://localhost:8000` and start scrolling.

## 📬 Feedback & Bugs

* **"The meteors are falling up!"** -> That's a feature. Gravity is subjective here.
* **"I found a bug in the coral."** -> It's organic growth.

No no, If you actually find something broken, or just want to say hi to the jellyfish, ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marielynneblock/) or open an issue.

**Happy Scrolling!** 🖱️

# ✨ The Munchkin Algorithm ✨

> **By day, I optimise algorithms for efficiency. By night, I build them to make you *feel* something.**

**Welcome to my digital `.world`**

*This repo isn't just a portfolio website; it's a **scrolling experience** disguised as a professional resume.*

## 🎭 The Experience

### 🚀 The Journey (Scroll to Experience)

The entire background is powered by **p5.js**. It doesn't play a video; it *renders* the universe in real-time based on your scroll behaviour.

**Can you:**
- 🚀 Make the rocket fly?
- 💫 Make a wish on a falling star?
- 🪼 Reach the jellyfish?
- 🌊 Dive into the deep sea?

### 🎨 The "No Static Images" Manifesto

I have a strict rule for this `.world`:

> **Every pixel must be separately programmed.**

| ❌ Not Allowed | ✅ Allowed |
|:---:|:---:|
| JPEGs | 100% Code |
| PNGs | Generative Art |
| GIFs | Real-time Rendering |

> **Legal Disclaimer:** The favicon is a static image because browser security rules are boring and won't let me render a canvas there yet. *sadface.jpg* 🤪

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This site is built on the intersection of **Logic** and **Creative Chaos**.

### Core Technologies

```javascript
{
  "engine": "p5.js v1.7.0",
  "styling": "CSS3 Glassmorphism",
  "fonts": {
    "headers": "Orbitron",
    "data": "Rajdhani",
    "body": "Montserrat"
  },
  "animations": "Generative & Real-time",
  "performance": "Optimized & Throttled"
}
```

### 🎯 Key Features

- ✨ **Immersive Scroll Animation** - Background transitions through Space → Aurora → Sky → Sea Surface → Deep Sea
- 🎨 **Generative Service Icons** - Unique p5.js animations for each service card
- 💎 **Glassmorphism Design** - Modern, semi-transparent card design
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** - Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized** - Cached calculations, throttled scroll events, intersection observers
- 🎭 **Zero Static Images** - Everything is code-generated (except the favicon)

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Scroll Events:** Throttled to 16ms intervals
- **Rendering:** Elements in inactive zones stop rendering
- **Canvas Dimensions:** Cached to reduce property access
- **Intersection Observer:** Visibility-based rendering
- **Memory Management:** Efficient particle systems and cleanup

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (Python or Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarieLynneBlock/TheMunchkinAlgorithm_website.git
   cd TheMunchkinAlgorithm_website
   ```

2. **Start a local server:**
   
   > ⚠️ **Important:** Due to CORS policies, p5.js requires a local server. Don't just open `index.html` directly!

   **Option A: Python**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   **Option B: Node.js**
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Start scrolling!** 🖱️

## 🎨 Animation Zones

The scroll experience is divided into immersive zones:

| Zone | Scroll Range | Elements |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 🚀 **Space** | 0-2% | Stars, meteorites, rocket, satellite |
| 🌌 **Aurora** | 2-12% | Northern lights (L-system), enhanced stars |
| ☁️ **Sky** | 12-52% | Blue sky, clouds, birds |
| 🌅 **Sunset** | 62-85% | Warm colors, setting sun, ocean waves |
| 🌊 **Deep Sea** | 85-100% | Bubbles, fish, jellyfish, coral, seaweed |

## 🐛 Known "Features" & Bugs

| Report | Response |
|:---|:---|
| *"The meteors are falling up!"* | That's a feature. Gravity is subjective here. 🌌 |
| *"I found a bug in the coral."* | It's organic growth. 🪸 |
| *"The jellyfish are too slow!"* | They're meditating. 🧘 |
